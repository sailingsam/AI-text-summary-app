1. Try to modify the scripts and deploy on vercel

2. Because of separation of concern divide your backend and frontend differently, deploy frontend on vercel and backend on render

3. Maybe try to host it yourself on any cloud platform like aws

4. As your backend is very small, research about serverless functions on vercell or appwrite and deploy your backend there
